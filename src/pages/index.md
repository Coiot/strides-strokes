      H4H began with stroke prevention in mind, to educate the public on the benefits of healthy lifestyles in preventing this terrible illness. To do this, we wanted to host fitness events that educate the public, encourage donations, and inspire others to turn a new leaf on healthy lifestyles. We hope to expand our mission and work with healthcare providers across Florida & the nation.

    title: Strides & Strokes!
    content: >
      Summer 2022 will mark the second Humans4Health (H4H) event and also our first “annual” donation campaign called Strides4Strokes (S4S). Teams from across six OrangeTheory clubs in the Orlando area will compete during a 90-minute workout session. This friendly competition will promote OrangeTheory’s and H4H’s mission to encourage healthy lifestyles. Funds raised will go towards neurological research and care.


      We are once again partnering with the AdventHealth Neuroscience Institute, which is dedicated to providing whole-person care for neurological conditions such as stroke, brain tumors, spinal conditions, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, headaches, sleep disorders, Parkinson’s disease, and more.


      Your donations, no matter the size, will help bring care to those struggling with the 24/7 challenge of neurological illnesses.
      Stay tuned for more details, follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/humans.4.health/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Humans.4.Health)!

          I have a personal connection to this initiative.  I lost my mother to
          stroke complications in May of 2018.

          My Mother, Mary Ann, had suffered some minor stroke episodes leading
          up to the final brain injury in May 2018 and days later she was gone.

          At the end of that same year, I had a close friend suffer a stroke.
          He is two years younger than I, and continues to this day, to try and
          regain the lifestyle he once had.  Two years later, he continues to
          fight.  What is so impressive about my dear friend James and his Wife
          Margaret, is their never ending will to fight.  A fight that requires
          endurance, a fight that requires multiple layers of care.  A fight
          that has been supported by family and friends, and their love of God.
          What is astounding, Is that I have never personally witnessed James
          and Margaret without a smile. Negative attitudes have not been present
          in their recovery.


          It is their will and determination that has inspired me to dedicate
          our first fundraising initiative to the professionals who have
          provided care to James throughout the recovery journey he has so
          impressively stayed committed.


          James's care has been provided by the medical professionals of
          **AdventHealth Central Florida**.
